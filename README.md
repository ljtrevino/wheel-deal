### Flex Boxers

## Wheel Deal

# Purpose
Our website helps people gain access to bikes by renting them from bike owners who aren’t using their bikes. In exchange for being able to use the bike, the rider pays the owner a rental fee.

# Final Product
On the account side of things, users can sign up for an account, sign in/out, and change their password. Users can view bike listings, and filter them by location, price, and availability. Bike owners can also create a listing for their bike, set the bike’s location, availability, price, as well as edit or remove the bike. Riders can create a “ride”, use the “ride”, cancel it, and view what rides they have on file.  An electronic handshake is used to transfer the bike between the rider and owner and then back.  Additionally, riders can rate bikes they have ridden as well as users whose bike they have ridden.  Owners can also report bikes stolen that are not returned on time.
